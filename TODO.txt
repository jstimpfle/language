Make a distinction:
    1) exiting early when a compiler logic bug was detected
    2) exiting early when there is an error in the project to be compiled

Things that don't work in PECOFF writer (pe64.c):
  - Symbol relative relocations. I think PECOFF has a mechanism where the
    addend must be stored in the actual place where the relocated address
    should be later put. That's pretty awkward! If we don't get that to work we
    might have to resort simply to an anonymous symbol for each symbol-relative
    relocation.
  - BSS section isn't output. There must be some strange thing going on. Maybe
    sections must be aligned in the file to a multiple of some value?

Calling to function pointers does not seem to work (compiler or machine code
emitter).

Need to support loading and moving quantities other than 64-bit integers (IR /
machine code emitter)

Detect and fail on symbol collisions early. Especially simple declarations
where type and name of a variable name are swapped can be hard to debug when
collisions aren't reported.

Give some love to prettyprint.c. Make output truer to input file by walking
global directives.

Make a distinction:
    1) exiting early when a compiler logic bug was detected
    2) exiting early when there is an error in the project to be compiled

Calling to function pointers does not seem to work (compiler or machine code
emitter).

Need to support loading and moving quantities other than 64-bit integers (IR /
machine code emitter). (UPDATE: partly implemented: can load/store chars)

Think about and implement syntax for complex literals (arrays and structs). We
also want to support addressof-literal expressions, even for complex literals.

Do some easy to have machine optimizations. For example, for subscripts with
constant indices, there is no need to compute the offset at runtime.
